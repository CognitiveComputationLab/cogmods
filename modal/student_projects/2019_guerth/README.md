# mModalSentential

The goals of this project are:
1. Writing a modular Python program, that has the same functionality as the existing Lisp program 'mSentential.lisp' \
(Which can be found here: http://mentalmodels.princeton.edu/models/)
2. Extending this program to support modal operators (both in premises and conclusions).
