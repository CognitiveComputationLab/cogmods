# Transitive Inference

The goal of this project was to investigate the functioning of models for transitive reasoning. For this purpose, models were implemented in a version of
CCOBRA and evaluated on a number of different data sets. Species included
in the evaluation are pigeons, wasps, macaque monkeys and humans. 
Nine versions of associative reasoning models and three cognitive reasoning models for Transitive Inference (TI) reasoning were implemented in Python and
evaluated using the Cognitive Computation for Behavioral Reasoning Analysis
(CCOBRA) Framework.

## Models
Implemented Models are:
- RL-ELO
- RL-ELO F
- Value Transfer Theory
- Rescorla-Wagner
- Configural Cues
- Bush-Mosteller
- Siemann-Delius
- Internal Linear Array
- Spatial Paralogic Theory
- Stimulus Control Topography
- Baseline: Random Decision
- Baseline: Correct Reply
