# Reasoning with Misinformation

The goal of this undergraduate thesis was to evaluate predictive performance of socio–psychological theories on news headline and misinformation acceptance. For this, a number of cognitive and heuristic modeling approaches were selected from recent influential research, implemented in the CCOBRA framework and can be evaluated using provided individual participant data from experimental studies. 


## Models
Implemented Models and as summary of their respective proposition are listed below:
- **Classical Reasoning**
-- People who think analytically, classify news items more accurately.
- **Motivated Reasoning**
-- People who think analytically, classify information as correct that is favorable with respect to their own political stance.
- **Suppression by Mood**
-- Experiencing an intensive mood, shifts people's news item accept versus reject tendency. 
- **Fast-And-Frugal Tree: Max**
-- Decision Tree strategy that implements the Take-The-Best heuristic.
- **Fast-And-Frugal Tree: ZigZag (Z+)**
-- Decision Tree strategy that implements the Take-The-Best heuristic and alternates exit directions on every cue. 
- **Fast-And-Frugal Tree: ifan**
-- Decision Tree strategy optimized for best performance in high-risk decision situations.
- **Recognition Heuristic**
-- News items with perceived familiarity over a certain threshold are accepted. 
- **Recognition Heuristic (linear)**
-- News items with high perceived familiarity are accepted more often. 
- **Classical Reasoning & Reaction Time**
-- People who give slow responses, classify news items as incorrect more often.
- **Linear Combination: News Item Pretest Measures**
-- Acceptance probability can be determined by various pretest measures of a news item. 
- **Linear Combination: Sentiment Analysis**
-- Acceptance probability can be determined by sentiment analysis of a news item headline. 
- **Linear Combination: Selected Features ("FPIT")**
-- Acceptance probability can be determined by a small set of selected pretest measures of a news item. 
- **Baseline: Random Decision**
-- Randomly predict accept or reject responses. 
- **Baseline: Correct Reply**
-- Always predict the accurate classification for a news item.
- **Recommender: Linear Combination of Features**
-- Model the prediction of a participant as the mean of other people that share similar features.
