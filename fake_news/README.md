# Reasoning with Misinformation

The goal of this undergraduate thesis was to evaluate predictive performance of socioâ€“psychological theories on news headline and misinformation acceptance. For this, a number of cognitive and heuristic modeling approaches were selected from recent influential research, implemented in the CCOBRA framework and can be evaluated using provided individual participant data from experimental studies. 


## Models
Implemented Models are:
- Classical Reasoning
- Motivated Reasoning
- Suppression by Mood
- Fast-And-Frugal Tree: ZigZag (z+)
- Fast-And-Frugal Tree: Max
- Fast-And-Frugal Tree: ifan
- Recognition Heuristic
- Recognition Heuristic (linear)
- Classical Reasoning & Reaction Time
- Linear Combination: News Item Pretest Measures
- Linear Combination: Sentiment Analysis
- Linear Combination: Selected Features ("FPIT")
- Baseline: Random Decision
- Baseline: Correct Reply
- Recommender: Linear Combination of Features
