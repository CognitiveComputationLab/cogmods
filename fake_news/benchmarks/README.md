# Reasoning with Misinformation
## Notes On Benchmarks
- Dataset exp1.csv is excluded in this repository, as not entirely published by the authors yet as to September 2020. Thus, benchmarks for Experiment 1 can currently not be evaluated using only data from this directory. 
- For the given extensive data sets, some models take a long time to pre-train and individually adjust parameters per individual. Thus, benchmarks "noPrePerson" that use approximative globally-optimized parameter values (not taking into account person-specific background data) are provided for quicker testing and benchmarks "mini" for a smaller subset of experiment data.
