# Reasoning with Misinformation
## Notes On Benchmarks
- Dataset exp1.csv is excluded in this repository, as not entirely published by the authors yet as to September 2020. Thus, benchmarks for Experiment 1 can currently not be evaluated using only data from this directory. 
- Some models take a long time to pre-train or optimize per person. Thus, benchmarks that use approximative globally-optimized performance values (not taking into account person-specific background data) are provided for quick testing.
