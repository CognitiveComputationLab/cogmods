In syllogistic reasoning inferences over categorical assertions quantified via *All*, *Some*, *No*, *Some ... not* are drawn. Traditionally, syllogisms consist of two premises interrelating three terms (*pilots*, *skaters*, *musicians*). The goal in syllogistic reasoning tasks is to asses the relationship between both premises (based on the middle-term *skaters*) and making a quantified inference about the end-terms (*pilots*, *musicians*).

Since psychological research has shown that humans do not follow classical logics when reasoning over syllogisms, the field of cognitive modeling tries to uncover the fundamentals of human inference mechnisms by proposing models incorporating high-level assumptions about human cognition.
