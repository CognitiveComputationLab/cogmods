(unfinished)

Works with python 3.7


Directories:

data/ --- experimental syllogistic data
plots/ --- empty directories for various plots to show model performance in detail (filled by analyse_models.py)
prediction_goals/ --- benchmarks for predictions of rebuilt models (used by verify_predictions.py)

modular_models/models/basic_models/ --- rebuilt syllogistic reasoning models with a common, simple and specialized interface.
modular_models/models/ccobra_models/ --- CCobra versions of basic models + tree model
modular_models/util/ --- utility functions


Example calls:

1. Verify predictions of rebuilt models:
>>> python verify_predictions.py
VerbalModels should have one wrong prediction.

2. Fill plots/ directory to break down the models' performances in more detail (might take a while).
>>> python analyse_models.py

3. Basic models prediction
>>> from modular_models.models.basic_models import Atmosphere
>>> m = Atmosphere()
>>> m.predict("OA1")
['Oac']  # or ['Oca']
