# Predicitive modeling for individual human reasoning

Syllogistic reasoning models implemented by Evelyn Wiens as part of the bachelor thesis in early 2021.
Different theories based on mental models are implemented (MMT, mReasoner, Verbal Models) with different strategies for alternative model search / reencoding.
Response time and results of a LDT are used to manipulate the internal Paramters of the Models to boost their performance.
