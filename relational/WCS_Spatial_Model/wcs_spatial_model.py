    This class implements the Weak-Completion-Semantics approach for solving spatial
    reasoning tasks.
    The function "compute_problem" solves a single spatial task by creating a logic program
    founded on the input premises and reason based on the least model of the according
    logic program. The class "LogicProgram" is a helper-class which contains all functions
    to create and compute logic programs.

        This function computes a spatial problem consisting of several premises and a query.
        The function first creates a logic program which comprises rules encoding the computation
        process to obtain the preferred mental model. After that, all problem premises are added
        to the program. Then the least model of the program is computed, resulting in the preferred
        mental model (model construction phase). This model entails whether the problem query holds
        or does not hold, by searching for the relation encoding this query with the help of the
        function "compute_conclusion" (model inspection phase).
        If the query holds in the preferred model and variation is enabled (via the boolean
        "perform_variation"), the third and last phase (model variation phase) is processed,
        which may lead to alternative models and conclusions.
        Finally, a dictionary of all valid models with their according swap distance (from the
        preferred model) and the answer to the query is printed. Based on this dictionary, a final
        conclusion can be drawn - if the query relation does not hold in at least one of the
        resulting models, then the query is rejected.

        """
        This function creates the initial logic program for solving spatial relations, according
        to the specified objects and phases in the input parameters. The model created by applying
        these rules is the preferred mental model, which is obtained by using the first-free-fit-
        strategy(fff) for insertions of new objects.
        Altogether, there are 11 rules necessary to create the preferred model, summarized in the
        following. In order to mark ambiguities while constructing the models, 5 additional rules
        are needed (12a-14). Many of the rules need to be created for every object combination and
        time index, resulting in an exponential growth of rules, depending on the amount of
        objects for the problem. Some of the following rules are added in the function
        "add_premise_requests" (1, 14).

        The rules are:
        1.  Initial placement request. i is premise-number in problem
            - l(o1, o2, i) <-- True (left);    l(o2, o1, i) <-- True (right)
        2.  Closed world assumption for l-atom (relation)
            - l(o1, o2, 1) <-- False
        3.  All positions are not occupied in the beginning
            - ol(o, 1) <-- False;    or(o, 1) <-- False
        4.  Set direct left neighbour
            - ln(o1, o2, i) <-- l(o1, o2, i) and -ol(o2, i) and -or(o1, i)
        5.  ln-atom holds in the next phase:
            - ln(o1, o2, i+1) <-- ln(o1, o2, i)
        6.  Set occupied positions
            - ol(o2, i+1) <-- ln(o1, o2, i);   or(o1, i+1) <-- ln(o1, o2, i)
        7.  Adapted placement request:
            - l(o3, o1, i+1) <-- l(o3, o2, i+1) and ln(o1, 02, i)
        8.  Adapted placement request II
            - l(o2, o3, i+1) <-- l(o1, o3, i+1) and ln(o1, o2, i)
        9.  Direct left neighbourhood implies general left-relation. n is the last premise number
            - left(o1, o2) <-- ln(o1, o2, n)
        10. Transitivity of left-relation
            - left(o1, o3) <-- left(o1, o2) and left(o2, o3)
        11. Inverse of left-relation is right-relation
            - right(o1, o2) <-- left(o2, o1)

        Additional rules to enable the amb-atoms and il-constraints, which are later needed for the
        variation program:
        12a. Ambiguous objects found - mark ambiguity trough ambiguous-atom
             - amb(o3, o1, i+1) <-- l(o3, o2, i+1) and ln(o1, o2, i)
        12b. Ambiguous objects found - mark ambiguity trough ambiguous-atom II
             - amb(o3, o2, i+1) <-- l(o1, o3, i+1) and ln(o1, o2, i)
        13a. Pass on ambiguity-annotations (when a new object o3 should be inserted next to object
             o2, which is already marked as ambiguous, then the new object o3 is ambiguos as well).
             - amb(o3, o1, i+1) <-- l(o3, o2, i+1) and amb(o1, o2, i)
        13b. Pass on ambiguity-annotations II
             - amb(o3, o2, i+1) <-- l(o1, o3, i+1) and amb(o1, o2, i)
        14.  Initial placement requests. i is premise-number of the problem
             - il(o1, o2, i) <-- True (left);    il(o2, o1, i) <-- True (right)

        boolean value (leading to a non-satisfied rule), then the consequent is set to True/False

        need to satisfy the condition, that the boolean values of all according bodies are False

        no more rule-heads to assign, the least fixed point is found and the iteration-process
