# Name:        Spatial Reasoning Model Validation
# Purpose:     Module of functions which perform model validation and
#              variation. When a conclusion premise is reached, the conclusion
#              has to be verified in the mental model. If it is true in the
#              mental model, we look for alternative models where it is false.
#              If it is false in the mental model, we look for alternative
#              models in which it is true.
