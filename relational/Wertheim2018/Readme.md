Explaining Reasoning Effects: A Neural Cognitive Model of Spatial Reasoning
========

The model impplemnets relational reasoning tasks in the neural engineering framework with two-dimensional relations, e.g., "A is to the left of B. B is to the left of C. C is to the left of D." The tasks are solved by displaying the premises' objects on a two-dimensional display on which they are rearranged based on the incoming information from the further premises in order to maintain a coherent model. 
The implemented tasks encompass relational reasoning tasks with three to eight premises, as well as tasks used by Bucher, Krumnack, Nejasmic & Knauff (2011) and Nejasmic, Bucher & Knauff (2015).
