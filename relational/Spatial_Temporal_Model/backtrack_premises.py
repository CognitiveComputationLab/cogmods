    Function extracts the relevant subject and object of the question and

    p_search returns all premises which are necessary to solve the problem.
    The question is added to this new premise set and interpret is called again

def p_update(path, prems):
    """
    Function that updates the current path with the next found and fitting premises.
    First, the function calls prem_lis in order to find all premises, which contain
    the current last element of "path". These premises are saved in "outlis".
    In the next step, check for each premise in "outlis", whether the other
    element of the premise (which was not the last element in path), is already
    a member of the path. All of these elements, which are already part of the path,
    are saved in a list, which is afterwards subtracted from "outlis", which
    means that only those premises remain in outlis, which contain elements that
    are not already a part of the path.
    Afterwards, the function creates a list (here tmp_list2), where all next
    potential path-elements are appended.
    In the fourth step of the function, each of the potential following path
    elments is added after the current last path element and with that,
    creates a new (or several new) path(s). The new path(s) are returned to pSearch.

    Example:
    path = ["A", "B"] and premises "A happens before B", "B happens before C",
    "C happens before D" --> function returns new path = ["A","B","C"]
